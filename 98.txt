Job description
Who we are
Sema is using cutting-edge machine learning science to reduce technical debt and transform software maintenance.

Our team includes some of the best software and machine learning researchers and technologists on the planet. We’re looking for an exceptional Software Engineer to join our team.
Please note: This position will begin remotely, eventually migrating to one of our hubs, in Southeast Michigan, Baltimore or other. A portion of your compensation may be in equity.
Also note that no sponsorship is available. Must be a U.S. Citizen or Green Card Holder.

A “hands on the keyboard” Java developer
Experience developing web-services, APIs and other backend code
Experience with Relational and NoSQL databases
Experience with Cloud development and deployment, preferably Amazon Web Services
Senior-level fluency in two or more of the following:
Object-oriented languages (such as Java, C#, C++, Python, etc.)
Other modern programming languages (such as Ruby, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
Familiarity with legacy languages a plus
Experience in all phases of software development life cycle, including
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI / CD)
Automated Testing
What you’ll do
Hands-on development of the company's product(s), especially the back-end services
Architect for the company's product and subject matter expert on the effective use of technology
Focal point for architecture governance and technical standards
Ensure the quality of the company’s product meet the established standards
Work with other software engineers and architects to ensure quality is designed and built in the system
Actively grow your knowledge in pertinent technology, processes and tools
Compensation
We offer competitive compensation including stock options, and the rare opportunity to contribute significantly to the growth of a new company from the very beginning.
We will consider and adjust the level of responsibility and compensation for exceptional candidates with different levels of seniority and experience. 
Benefits
