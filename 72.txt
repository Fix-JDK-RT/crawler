What is this?
This is a collection of common Q&A. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining it.
Why is this?
regex is suffering from give me ze code type of questions and poor answers with no explanation. This reference is meant to provide links to quality Q&A.
What's the scope?
This reference is meant for the following languages: php, perl, javascript, python, ruby, java, .net.
This might be too broad, but these languages share the same syntax. For specific features there's the tag of the language behind it, example:

The Stack Overflow Regular Expressions FAQ
Online tutorials
RegexOne
Regular Expressions Info
Quantifiers
Zero-or-more: *:greedy, *?:reluctant, *+:possessive
One-or-more: +:greedy, +?:reluctant, ++:possessive
?:optional (zero-or-one)
Min/max ranges (all inclusive): {n,m}:between n & m, {n,}:n-or-more, {n}:exactly n
Differences between greedy, reluctant (a.k.a. "lazy", "ungreedy") and possessive quantifier:
Greedy vs. Reluctant vs. Possessive Quantifiers
In-depth discussion on the differences between greedy versus non-greedy
What's the difference between {n} and {n}?
Can someone explain Possessive Quantifiers to me? php, perl, java, ruby
Emulating possessive quantifiers .net
Non-Stack Overflow references: From Oracle, regular-expressions.info
Character Classes
What is the difference between square brackets and parentheses?
[...]: any one character, [^...]: negated/any character but
[^] matches any one character including newlines javascript
[\w-[\d]] / [a-z-[qz]]: set subtraction .net, xml-schema, xpath, JGSoft
[\w&&[^\d]]: set intersection java, ruby 1.9+
[[:alpha:]]:POSIX character classes
Why do [^\\D2], [^[^0-9]2], [^2[^0-9]] get different results in Java? java
Shorthand:
Digit: \d:digit, \D:non-digit
Word character (Letter, digit, underscore): \w:word character, \W:non-word character
Whitespace: \s:whitespace, \S:non-whitespace
Unicode categories (\p{L}, \P{L}, etc.)
Escape Sequences
Horizontal whitespace: \h:space-or-tab, \t:tab
Newlines:
\r, \n:carriage return and line feed
\R:generic newline php
Negated whitespace sequences: \H:Non horizontal whitespace character, \V:Non vertical whitespace character, \N:Non line feed character pcre php5 java-8
Other: \v:vertical tab, \e:the escape character
Anchors
^:start of line/input, \b:word boundary, and \B:non-word boundary, $:end of line/input
\A:start of input, \Z:end of input php, perl, ruby
\z:the very end of input (\Z in Python) .net, php, pcre, java, ruby, icu, swift, objective-c
\G:start of match php, perl, ruby
(Also see "Flavor-Specific Information → Java → The functions in Matcher")
Groups
(...):capture group, (?:):non-capture group
Why is my repeating capturing group only capturing the last match?
\1:backreference and capture-group reference, $1:capture group reference
What's the meaning of a number after a backslash in a regular expression?
\g<1>123:How to follow a numbered capture group, such as \1, with a number?: python
What does a subpattern (?i:regex) mean?
What does the 'P' in (?P<group_name>regexp) mean?
(?>):atomic group or independent group,  (?|):branch reset
Equivalent of branch reset in .NET/C# .net
Named capture groups:
General named capturing group reference at regular-expressions.info
java: (?<groupname>regex): Overview and naming rules (Non-Stack Overflow links)
Other languages: (?P<groupname>regex) python, (?<groupname>regex) .net, (?<groupname>regex) perl, (?P<groupname>regex) and (?<groupname>regex) php
Lookarounds
Lookaheads: (?=...):positive, (?!...):negative
Lookbehinds: (?<=...):positive, (?<!...):negative (not supported by javascript)
Lookbehind limits in:
Lookbehinds need to be constant-length php, perl, python, ruby
Lookarounds of limited length {0,n} java
Variable length lookbehinds are allowed .net
Lookbehind alternatives:
Using \K php, perl (Flavors that support \K)
Alternative regex module for Python python
The hacky way
JavaScript negative lookbehind equivalents External link
Modifiers
Most flavors: g:global, i:case-insensitive, u:unicode, x:whitespace-extended
c:current position perl  e:expression php perl  o:once ruby
m:multiline php perl python javascript .net java, m:(non)multiline ruby
s:single line (not supported by javascript or ruby), s workaround javascript
S:study php  U:ungreedy php r
How to convert preg_replace e to preg_replace_callback?
What are inline modifiers?
What is '?-mix' in a Ruby Regular Expression
Other:
|:alternation (OR) operator, .:any character, [.]:literal dot character
What special characters must be escaped?
Control verbs (php and perl): (*PRUNE), (*SKIP), (*FAIL) and (*F)
php only: (*BSR_ANYCRLF)

(Except for those marked with *, this section contains non-Stack Overflow links.)
Java
Official documentation: Pattern Javadoc, Oracle's regular expressions tutorial
The differences between functions in java.util.regex.Matcher:
matches()): The match must be anchored to both input-start and -end
find()): A match may be anywhere in the input string (substrings)
lookingAt(): The match must be anchored to input-start only
(For anchors in general, see the section "Anchors")
The only java.lang.String functions that accept regular expressions: matches(s), replaceAll(s,s), replaceFirst(s,s), split(s), split(s,i)

.NET

When to not use regular expressions:
Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. (blog post written by Stack Overflow's founder)*
Do not use regex to parse HTML:
Don't.  Please, just don't
Well, maybe...if you're really determined (other answers in this question are also good)
