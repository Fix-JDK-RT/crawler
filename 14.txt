Frequently asked questions
General & Privacy
Who can use Stack Overflow for Teams?
Any group working on a project together can use Teams. While we started Stack Overflow to solve problems facing developers, we’ve seen other kinds of organizations use Stack Overflow for Teams, from college classrooms to entire startups.
Will public Stack Overflow users be able to see my Team’s Q&A?
Absolutely not. Only the users you add to your Team can see your questions and answers.
                
What kind of API is available?

                    We currently offer a robust Read API, and will release the Write API soon.
                
What happens to my data if I cancel my Team?
When your Team is canceled, you will have access until the end of your subscription period (end of the month or year). Then, your data will convert to read-only mode for 60 days. At any time, you can export your data to a json file or renew your account. After the 60-day period, your data will be deleted.

Our Team has inactive users. Do we still have to pay for them?
Nope. We only charge you for active users (i.e., users who have not been manually deactivated). If any of your users are deactivated, we will add a pro-rated credit for any remaining time to your account.
We need to add new users to our Team. How will that be billed?
Simply invite as many users as you need. We’ll make a prorated charge on your credit card once a month.
What’s your cancellation and refund policy?
