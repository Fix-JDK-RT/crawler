Stack Overflow for Enterprise
 Your own Stack Overflow with unlimited Teams
 Host anywhere
 Single sign-on: AD, SAML
 Dedicated customer success team
 99.5% uptime SLA & priority support
Contact sales
Efficient
Solve problems fast and speed up development
The average roadblock costs more than 40 minutes to resolve. Stack Overflow’s Q&A engine gives your team instant access to expert knowledge from their peers so that they can get back to building great products.
Scalable
Onboard new team members faster
It can be time-consuming to help new hires ramp up on internal systems and knowledge. Stack Overflow gives new hires access to the most relevant, up-to-date information so they can ramp up without slowing down the rest of the team.
Secure
Keep your data safe
Rest easy knowing your organization’s data is secure in a private, standalone instance hosted on your server or private cloud with single sign-on (SSO) and multi-team permissions.
Seamlessly integrates with your workflows

                    Use our robust API to integrate with your existing tools and systems. Display results in global search, get notifications in Slack, or answer new questions from anywhere.
                
Host anywhere
Whether you want to host your community yourself or hand off the reins to us, we’ve got you covered. Host on your cloud, your own servers, or our private managed cloud.
Subdivide information through private Teams
Want to share information with only a small group? Use private Teams to subdivide information so that it’s visible only to a subset of employees.
Add as much (or as little) structure as your organization needs
Tags are a quick, flexible way to structure your organization’s data. Employees can browse the tag list to check out topics that interest them, or watch tags for quick access.
Dedicated Customer Success & Community Building
You’re not just buying software, you’re building a community—we’re here for you every step of the way with our experience and expertise to ensure your community thrives and grows.
Analytics and insights
We know how important it is to measure success for any tool. You’ll have access to question, tag, and user-level usage analytics so you can observe and understand engagement over time.
Your team already knows and loves Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow for Enterprise gives you everything that 50 million people already love about Stack Overflow in a private, secure environment.
